# INSAID_FRAUD_DETECTION
# Overview:
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict fraudulent transactions for a financial company. The dataset consists of over 6 million transactions with 10 features. The goal is to accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives, leveraging the Random Forest algorithm's ability to handle imbalanced datasets.

# Project Structure:
## Dataset: 
The dataset is provided in CSV format with 6,362,620 rows and 10 columns. The data includes both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

# Objective: 
Develop a predictive model to identify fraudulent transactions and create an actionable plan based on the model's insights.
